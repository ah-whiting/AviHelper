      <h1><strong>Type: Wind Slab</strong></h1>
      <p class="border-bottom aviDesc">
        <strong>Wind Slab</strong> avalanches are the release of a cohesive
        layer of snow (a slab) formed by the wind. Wind typically transports
        snow from the upwind sides of terrain features and deposits snow on the
        downwind side. Wind slabs are often smooth and rounded and sometimes
        sound hollow, and can range from soft to hard. Wind slabs that form over
        a persistent weak layer (surface hoar, depth hoar, or near-surface
        facets) may be termed Persistent Slabs or may develop into Persistent
        Slabs.
