# AviHelper

Outdoor recreationists and avalanche professionals die every year in avalanches across the nation and the world. Traveling safely in avalanche prone terrain requires careful analysis of historical and current weather data, some of which is performed for the public by institutions such as NWAC(Northwest Avalanche Center). AviHelper is a web application that pulls raw weather data and uses custom algorithms to make predictions about avalanche dangers specific to location, elevation, and aspect. AviHelper also generates associated visualizations with d3.js and provides for user interactivity with targeted data.
